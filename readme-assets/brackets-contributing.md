# Forked Guelstie
If you forked Guelstie Plugins then you will want to clone the now forked repo to your local PC

Change `ltngames` to your github username

`git clone https://github.com/ltngames/Guelstie-Plugins`

Now you will want to add the main Guelstie repo as a new remote because origin will now point to your GitHub repo not Guelstie main repo.

Name it `upstream` you may name it to what you please but upstream is pretty common.

When asked for a remote url use `https://github.com/Guelstie/Guelstie-Plugins.git`
